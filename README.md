### Symbols' Description

`0`- `S`:   Susceptible: Healthy and susceptible to the coronavirus

`1`- `E`:   Exposed: Have already exposed to the coronavirus but haven't become infectious for others

`2`- `Ip`:  Pre-symptomatically infected: During infectious period before showing symptoms

`3`- `Ia`:  Asymptomatically infected: Being infectious but showing no symptoms

`4`- `Is`:  Symptomatically infected: Being infectious and have started showing symptoms

`5`- `R`:   Recovered: Have already recovered from COVID-19, thus have an antibody for now

`6`- `Ih`:  Hospitalization: Be in hospitalized after being symtomatically infected 

`7`- `D`:   Dead

`10`- `RP`: Have recovered from COVID-19 thus have an antibody before the beginning of the semester


### Input Files

`AffiliationMatrix.csv` / `AffiliationMatrixAll.csv` includes the assignment of all courses for all students, which is generated from the 2019 Fall registration data

`AffiliationMatrixOnCampus.csv` includes the assignment of all courses for all students living on campus, which is depended on the course scheduling strategy and housing scenario

`AffiliationMatrix_M/T/W/R/F/S.csv` includes the assignment of courses for students each weekday from Monday to Saturday respectively

### Output Files

`Average.csv` shows the average simulation results of total runs, which have # Cumulative Cases, # New Cases, # Quarantine, etc. 

`1.csv`....`100.csv`shows the simulation results of each individual run respectively.


### Different versions of simulation model

**1\.Version 1:** 

Calculate infections in class through assumed Closed-Form Formula


**2\. Version 2:**

Calculate infections in class through sampling students sitting close to each student

Calculate infections on weekends through sampling students get contacted with each student


**3\. Version 3:**

Calculate infections in class based on transmission rate & total number of infected students in a class

Calculate infections on weekends through sampling students get contacted with each student


**4\. Version 4:**

Calculate infections in class based on in-class transmission rate & total number of infected students in a class

Calculate infections outside of the class but on campus based on outside-of-class transmission rate & total number of infected students in school

Calculate infections off campus based on off-campus transmission rate & total number of infections in Fulton county

Calculate infections on weekends through sampling students get contacted with each student per day


**5\. Version 5:**

Modify based on version 4 to adapt to the new hybrid strategies.


**6\. Version 6:**

Modify based on version 5 to add interventions including wearing masks, testing (3% of all students per day), and quarantine.


**7\. Version 7:**

Modify based on version 6 to add interventions including wearing masks, testing (300 students per day), quarantine, and contact tracing.

**8\. Version 8:**
